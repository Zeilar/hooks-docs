Is the browser online? See the hook in action by disconnecting the browser's connection.

One way to disconnect the browser's connection is to go to `DevTools -> Network -> Find the Throttling dropdown and put it to "Offline"`.

<UseIsOnlineDemo />

```tsx
import { useIsOnline } from "@zeilar/hooks";
import React from "react";

function UseIsOnlineDemo() {
	const isMounted = useIsOnline();
	return <pre>{String(isMounted())}</pre>;
}
```
